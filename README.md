# weather_sheet
 Pull weather data from an API and insert into a google sheet

## Specifications
- Read the requested latitudes and longitudes (from columns A and B).
- Fetch the latest weather information for each latitude/longitude.
- Write that information back into the sheet (into columns C, D, and E). Note that column E should just contain the timestamp of when the data was fetched from the weather API.
